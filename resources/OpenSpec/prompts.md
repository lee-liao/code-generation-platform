# OpenSpec Implementation Prompts

## Primary Implementation Prompt
The project has been set up for spec-driven development with detailed specifications in OpenSpec standards. The specifications are detailed enough be implemented without any user input. Read the OpenSpec change requirements under @openspec/changes/** and implement the specification. Create the required files and directories as specified in the OpenSpec document. After implementation, verify the new created files fulfill the requirements.

## Validation Prompt
After implementing the OpenSpec requirements, review the created files to ensure they match the specifications exactly. Pay attention to:
- All requirements mentioned in the OpenSpec document have been implemented
- All scenarios have appropriate code coverage
- Error handling is implemented as specified
- API endpoints follow the defined specifications
- File structure matches the requirements
